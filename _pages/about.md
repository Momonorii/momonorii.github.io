Hello!!!
My name is, Momonorii! I'm also known as Mamaur or Omnom and this is my practice website for getting into IT. I am very new to the world of IT and code so, this is my starting point for my IT CV. I am a Vtuber in my free time and enjoy video games, movies and music. I also dabble in crochet in my off time and work in retail currently. O_O

I have been playing Minecraft for an extremely long time and a lot of my time on Twitch is spent playing a mix of Minecraft, Call of Duty Black Ops 2: Zombies, mascot horror games like; Poppy Playtime, Joyville, My Friendly Neighborhood and Hello Puppets. Minecraft however, is my main category on the streaming and content creation sphere. 

I have always enjoyed being behind a computer in general as it's easier for me to just exist quietly behind a model or a voice as I have bad social anxiety in real life social situations sometimes but once I'm confident in a workplace or around certain people, I tend to be very confident and outspoken. I'd say my best traits are that I'm very hardworking when I chose to be, I like to support my colleagues, friends and family in whatever way they need and my punctuality in social, working or online situations. Being late is the worst to me.

I have been watching YouTube since I was very small and have always enjoyed creators like: WatchMojo, Dan Howell, AmazingPhil, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Boze VS the World, Tommyinnit and Kenji+. I have a very ecclectic taste on what I watch and listen to regularly online and on spotify and this could vary from True crime podcasts/ videos to Sims 4 gameplay with Dan and Phil or a Happy Wheels Compilation by Jacksepticeye.
Recently it became apparant that I had not started my build on YouTube for myself so I began this long journey for myself and I went from Twitch to YouTube as well. Two sites I've always enjoyed watching on and now I'm apart of them both. Although there are downfalls to being a creator on these sites, being able to show my creativity online through these platforms is a major motivator in my day-to-day life online.

I have always enjoyed being behind a screen. Theres just something that connects with me so easily in comparison to writing on paper. Typing, managing, socialising etc: it's just so much easier for me. In Secondary School when I took IT, I was always told how well I was doing and for a period of time in Sixth Form I had considered trying to apply to a Computing course in Breda, Netherlands. I never ended up going and in fact, I ended up dropping out of a Film School in Liverpool, UK instead. School was just never it for me. Being in a working environment or behind a screen was just so much easier. I found out I had ADHD and Asperges at 18 so, school had always caused me a lot of agro and bad memories. I find I thrive much better either alone behind a screen, in a team or doing something that keeps me really busy in person. Being lectured while holding a pen and paper just was never it. 

My IT teachers had always told me they think I could do well if I pursued IT fully and I never took their advice originally. But here I am. Picking up where I left off years and years ago and giving a chance at what I was good at previously.
