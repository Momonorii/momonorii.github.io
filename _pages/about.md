Hello!!!
My name is, Momonorii! I'm also known as Mamaur or Omnom and this is my practice website for getting into IT. I am very new to the world of IT and code so, this is my starting point for my IT CV. I am a Vtuber in my free time and enjoy video games, movies and music. I also dabble in crochet in my off time and work in retail currently. O_O

I have been playing Minecraft for an extremely long time and a lot of my time on Twitch is spent playing a mix of Minecraft, Call of Duty Black Ops 2: Zombies, mascot horror games like; Poppy Playtime, Joyville, My Friendly Neighborhood and Hello Puppets. Minecraft however, is my main category on the streaming and content creation sphere. 

I have always enjoyed being behind a computer in general as it's easier for me to just exist quietly behind a model or a voice as I have bad social anxiety in real life social situations sometimes but once I'm confident in a workplace or around certain people, I tend to be very confident and outspoken. I'd say my best traits are that I'm very hardworking when I chose to be, I like to support my colleagues, friends and family in whatever way they need and my punctuality in social, working or online situations. Being late is the worst to me.

I have been watching YouTube since I was very small and have always enjoyed creators like: WatchMojo, Dan Howell, AmazingPhil, Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, Boze VS the World, Tommyinnit and Kenji+. I have a very ecclectic taste on what I watch and listen to regularly online and on spotify and this could vary from True crime podcasts/ videos to Sims 4 gameplay with Dan and Phil or a Happy Wheels Compilation by Jacksepticeye.
Recently it became apparant that I had not started my build on YouTube for myself so I began this long journey for myself and I went from Twitch to YouTube as well. Two sites I've always enjoyed watching on and now I'm apart of them both. Although there are downfalls to being a creator on these sites, being able to show my creativity online through these platforms is a major motivator in my day-to-day life online.

Ego quoque, inquit, didicerim libentius si quid attuleris, quam te reprehenderim. Iam insipientes alios ita esse, ut nullo modo ad sapientiam possent pervenire, alios, qui possent, si id egissent, sapientiam consequi. Id quaeris, inquam, in quo, utrum respondero, verses te huc atque illuc necesse est. Sed quid ages tandem, si utilitas ab amicitia, ut fit saepe, defecerit? Sed isti ipsi, qui voluptate et dolore omnia metiuntur, nonne clamant sapienti plus semper adesse quod velit quam quod nolit? Quae quidem sapientes sequuntur duce natura tamquam videntes. Quod enim fitus dissolutum sit, id esse sine sensu, utilitas quod autem sine sensu sit, id nihil ad nos pertinere omnino. Idne consensisse de Calatino plurimas gentis arbitramur, primarium populi fuisse, quod praestantissimus fuisset in conficiendis voluptatibus? Utram tandem linguam nescio.
